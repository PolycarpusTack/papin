# MCP Client Testing and Deployment

This document provides an overview of the testing suite, CI/CD pipeline, and deployment strategy for the MCP Client application.

## Testing Strategy

The MCP Client implements a comprehensive testing strategy that includes multiple layers of testing to ensure code quality and application reliability.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. These tests are written using Rust's built-in testing framework and the `mockall` crate for mocking dependencies.

Key unit test files:
- `tests/unit/auto_update_test.rs`: Tests the auto-update functionality
- `tests/unit/optimization_test.rs`: Tests the performance optimization components
- `tests/unit/offline_test.rs`: Tests the offline capabilities

Best practices for unit tests:
- Each function should have at least one test
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests fast and independent

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly. These tests use real implementations of components but may mock external systems.

Key integration test files:
- `tests/integration/api_integration_test.rs`: Tests the API client integration
- `tests/integration/ui_integration_test.rs`: Tests the UI components integration
- `tests/integration/performance_test.rs`: Tests performance characteristics

Best practices for integration tests:
- Focus on component interactions
- Test realistic scenarios
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Isolate from external systems when possible

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-End (E2E) tests verify the entire application functions correctly from a user's perspective. These tests are written using Playwright and simulate real user interactions.

Key E2E test files:
- `tests/e2e/end_to_end_test.js`: Tests core functionality and user flows
- `tests/e2e/playwright.config.js`: Playwright configuration

Best practices for E2E tests:
- Focus on user-facing functionality
- Test critical user flows
- Use selectors that are resistant to UI changes
- Keep tests independent and idempotent

### Performance Benchmarking

Performance benchmarks measure the performance characteristics of critical components. These tests are written using the `criterion` crate.

Key benchmark files:
- `benches/performance_bench.rs`: Benchmarks for performance-critical components

Benchmarking best practices:
- Measure representative workloads
- Establish performance baselines
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Monitor for performance regressions

## CI/CD Pipeline

The MCP Client uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

### CI Workflow

The CI workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and includes the following jobs:

1. **Lint**
   - Rust formatting with `rustfmt`
   - Static analysis with `clippy`

2. **Test**
   - Unit tests on all platforms
   - Integration tests on all platforms

3. **Benchmarks**
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Store benchmark results as artifacts

4. **E2E Tests**
   - End-to-End tests with Playwright
   - Store test reports as artifacts

5. **Build**
   - Build application for all platforms
   - Store build artifacts

CI workflow triggers:
- On push to `main` and `develop` branches
- On pull requests to `main` and `develop` branches

### CD Workflow

The CD workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/release.yml` and handles the automatic release process:

1. **Create Release**
   - Triggered by version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
   - Creates a GitHub release

2. **Build and Upload**
   - Builds installers for all platforms
   - Uploads artifacts to the GitHub release

3. **Publish Update Manifest**
   - Creates update manifests for auto-update
   - Publishes manifests to the update server

4. **Notify**
   - Sends notifications about the release

## Telemetry Analysis

The MCP Client includes a comprehensive telemetry system for monitoring performance, errors, and usage in production.

### Telemetry Collection

The telemetry collection system is implemented in the `src/telemetry` module and includes:

- `TelemetryService`: Collects and sends telemetry data
- `TelemetryConfig`: Configures telemetry collection
- `TelemetryEvent`: Represents telemetry events

Types of telemetry collected:
- Application events (start/stop)
- Feature usage
- Errors and crashes
- Performance metrics
- Network events

### Telemetry Analysis

The `TelemetryAnalyzer` provides tools for analyzing telemetry data:

- Error trends analysis
- Performance metrics analysis
- User engagement analysis
- Anomaly detection

Telemetry reports:
- Daily health reports
- Weekly trends reports
- Monthly insights reports

### Privacy and Security

The telemetry system is designed with privacy and security in mind:

- Opt-in by default
- No personal identifiable information
- Anonymous device and user IDs
- Encrypted transmission
- Configurable data collection

## Release Process

The MCP Client follows a structured release process outlined in `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`:

1. **Pre-Release Preparation**
   - Update dependencies
   - Code freeze
   - Documentation updates

2. **Testing Phase**
   - Automated testing
   - Manual testing
   - Optional beta release

3. **Release Process**
   - Version bump
   - Final testing
   - Release tagging
   - CI/CD release build
   - Release publication

4. **Post-Release Steps**
   - User notification
   - Monitoring
   - Next development cycle

## Deployment Architecture

### Update Server

The MCP Client uses a custom update server for auto-updates:

- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Serves update manifests for each platform
- Supports incremental updates
- Verifies update integrity with signatures

### Installer Distribution

Installers are distributed through multiple channels:

- GitHub Releases
- Official website
- (Optional) Platform-specific stores

### Installation Channels

The MCP Client supports multiple installation methods:

1. **Windows**
   - MSI installer
   - Portable EXE

2. **macOS**
   - DMG installer
   - Universal binary

3. **Linux**
   - DEB package
   - RPM package
   - AppImage

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Production Monitoring

The MCP Client includes tools for monitoring the application in production:

- Error and crash reporting
- Performance monitoring
- Usage analytics
- Anomaly detection

### Hotfix Process

For critical issues, a hotfix process is defined:

1. Create hotfix branch from release tag
2. Fix the issue with minimal changes
3. Run focused tests
4. Update version
5. Release following the normal process
6. Backport to develop branch

## Best Practices and Guidelines
