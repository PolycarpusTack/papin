# MCP Client Telemetry Analysis Guide

This document outlines the telemetry collection, analysis, and monitoring process for the MCP Client application. Telemetry helps us identify issues, understand usage patterns, and improve the application based on real-world data.

## Telemetry Collection Overview

### Types of Telemetry Collected

The MCP Client collects the following types of telemetry data:

1. **Application Events**
   - Application start/stop
   - Feature usage
   - Settings changes
   - User engagement metrics

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Memory usage
   - API latency
   - Load times
   - LLM inference performance
   - Synchronization times

3. **Error Reporting**
   - Application errors
   - API call failures
   - Network issues
   - Business logic errors

4. **Crash Reporting**
   - Crashes with stack traces
   - Unhandled exceptions

### Privacy and Data Collection

- All telemetry collection is **opt-in** and disabled by default
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected
- Device and user IDs are anonymous and randomly generated
- Telemetry collection can be configured granularly (enable/disable specific types)
- Data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS
