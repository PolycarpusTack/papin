# Security and Privacy Features

## Overview

The MCP Client includes comprehensive security and privacy features designed to protect user data and provide transparency about how information is used. This document describes the key components of the security and privacy system.

## Key Components

### 1. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

The end-to-end encryption system ensures that data synchronized between devices remains private and secure:

- Uses ChaCha20-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption
- Implements X25519 for key exchange
- Provides forward secrecy through a double ratchet algorithm
- Automatically rotates keys for enhanced security
- No plaintext data is ever sent to remote servers

Implementation: `src/security/e2ee.rs`

### 2. Secure Credential Storage

Credentials and sensitive information are protected using platform-specific secure enclaves:

- Windows: Windows Credential Manager
- macOS: Keychain
- Linux: Secret Service API (GNOME Keyring/KWallet)
- Fallback: Encrypted local storage with strong obfuscation
- Configurable memory caching with automatic expiration

Implementation: `src/security/credentials.rs`

### 3. Data Flow Visualization

The data flow tracking system provides complete transparency about how data moves through the application:

- Visual graph of all data flows between components
- Classification of data sensitivity levels
- Real-time monitoring of data movement
- Historical logs of all data operations
- Filtering by classification level
- Statistics and insights about data usage

Implementation: `src/security/data_flow.rs`

### 4. Granular Permission Management

The permission system gives users fine-grained control over application capabilities:

- Individual permissions for each feature and data access
- Four permission levels: Always Allow, Ask First Time, Ask Every Time, Never Allow
- Categorized permissions for easy management
- Usage statistics to show which permissions are most frequently used
- Easy reset to default settings
- Required permissions are clearly marked

Implementation: `src/security/permissions.rs`

### 5. Privacy Controls

Additional privacy features ensure user control over their data:

- Anonymized telemetry with opt-out option
- Local-first architecture for offline usage
- Automatic clipboard clearing for sensitive data
- Encrypted local storage
- Minimal data collection by default
- Transparency about all data usage

Implementation: Various security components

## User Interface

The security and privacy features are accessible through a dedicated interface:

- **General Settings**: Configure encryption, secure storage, and privacy options
- **Permissions Manager**: Control granular permissions for all app features
- **Data Flow Visualization**: View and understand how data moves through the system
- **Credentials Manager**: Securely store and manage sensitive information

Implementation: `src-frontend/src/components/security/`

## Implementation Details

### Security Manager

The central security manager coordinates all security and privacy features:

- Initializes security services on application startup
- Provides a unified API for all security operations
- Handles configuration changes and updates
- Manages permissions and credential requests
- Tracks data flows between components

Implementation: `src/security/mod.rs`

### Secure Configuration

Security and privacy settings are stored in an encrypted configuration file:

- Default settings prioritize security and privacy
- User changes are persisted securely
- Configuration is loaded at startup with fallbacks for errors
- Validation ensures settings cannot be maliciously modified

### Cross-Platform Support

All security features work consistently across platforms:

- Uses platform-specific secure storage when available
- Falls back to robust cross-platform implementations when needed
- Adapts to different operating system security models
- Consistent user experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the security and privacy system:

1. **Biometric Authentication**: Add support for fingerprint/face recognition
2. **Hardware Security Keys**: Add support for YubiKey and similar devices
3. **Enhanced Audit Logging**: More detailed security event logs
4. **Third-Party Security Reviews**: Independent security audits
5. **Export Controls**: Allow users to export and delete all their data

## Development Guidelines

When extending the MCP client, follow these security principles:

1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store what's absolutely necessary
2. **Secure by Default**: All features should be secure in their default configuration
3. **User Control**: Always give users clear choices about their data
4. **Transparency**: Make data usage clear and understandable
5. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security for critical features
