# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation

This document provides an overview of the Model Context Protocol implementation in the Claude MCP Client. The implementation enables real-time communication with MCP-compatible servers for AI model interactions.

## Core Components

### Protocol Architecture

The MCP implementation follows a layered architecture:

1. **Protocol Definition** - Core types and interfaces in `protocols/mod.rs`
2. **MCP Protocol** - Protocol-specific implementation in `protocols/mcp/`
3. **WebSocket Client** - Low-level WebSocket communication in `protocols/mcp/websocket.rs`
4. **Message Types** - Message structures in `models/messages.rs` and `protocols/mcp/message.rs`
5. **Service Layer** - High-level abstractions in `services/mcp.rs` and `services/chat.rs`
6. **Command Layer** - Tauri command interface in `commands/mcp.rs` and `commands/chat.rs`

### Protocol Handlers

The protocol is implemented using a series of handler traits:

- `ProtocolHandler` - Base trait for all protocol handlers
- `McpProtocolHandler` - MCP-specific implementation
- `ProtocolFactory` - Factory for creating protocol handlers
- `McpProtocolFactory` - Factory for MCP handlers

### Message Flow

1. **Client to Server**: Messages originate from the UI, pass through the service layer, get converted to MCP format, and are sent via WebSocket.
2. **Server to Client**: Messages arrive via WebSocket, are parsed into MCP format, converted to application format, and dispatched to subscribers.

## Message Protocol

### Message Types

The MCP protocol supports several message types:

- `CompletionRequest` - Request a completion from the model
- `CompletionResponse` - Response containing the completion
- `StreamingMessage` - Chunk of a streaming response
- `StreamingEnd` - End of a streaming response
- `CancelStream` - Request to cancel a streaming response
- `Error` - Error message
- `Ping/Pong` - Heartbeat messages
- `AuthRequest/AuthResponse` - Authentication messages

### Message Structure

Each MCP message contains:

- `id`: Unique message identifier
- `version`: Protocol version
- `type`: Message type
- `payload`: Type-specific content

## WebSocket Communication

The WebSocket client manages the low-level communication with the MCP server:

- Connection establishment and authentication
- Message serialization and deserialization
- Heartbeat and reconnection logic
- Error handling and recovery

## Streaming Implementation

The client supports streaming responses through the following mechanisms:

1. Client sends a completion request with `stream: true`
2. Server responds with a series of `StreamingMessage` events
3. Client accumulates these chunks into a complete response
4. Server signals the end of streaming with a `StreamingEnd` message
5. Client notifies UI of completion

## Authentication

Authentication with MCP servers is handled through:

1. API key validation during initial connection
2. Session token management for persistent connections
3. Secure credential storage using the system's config manager

## Service Integration

The MCP protocol is integrated with the application through:

- `McpService` - Core service for MCP interactions
- `ChatService` - High-level abstraction for conversation management
- Tauri commands that expose functionality to the UI

## Error Handling

The implementation includes a comprehensive error handling approach:

- Protocol-specific error types with detailed information
- Error propagation through all layers
- Recovery mechanisms for transient failures
- Graceful degradation on critical failures

## Extending the Protocol

To add new MCP message types:

1. Add the type to `McpMessageType` enum
2. Create corresponding payload structure in `McpMessagePayload`
3. Implement handling logic in `McpClient`
4. Expose through the service layer as needed

## Security Considerations

The implementation includes several security measures:

- API keys are never exposed to the frontend
- TLS encryption for all WebSocket communications
- API scopes for limiting access
- Session token rotation on reconnection
- Timeout handling for all requests

## Performance Optimizations

The implementation is optimized for performance:

- Asynchronous processing of all network operations
- Lazy loading of non-essential components
- Message buffering for resilience
- Efficient message serialization
- Connection pooling and reuse

## Cross-Platform Considerations

While designed for Linux, the implementation works across platforms:

- Platform-agnostic protocol implementation
- Abstracted file system operations
- Configurable paths for platform-specific storage
- Consistent error handling across platforms
