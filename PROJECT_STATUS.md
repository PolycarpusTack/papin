# Claude MCP Client - Project Status

## Overview

The Claude MCP Client is a multi-interface application providing access to Anthropic's Claude AI models via both the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and traditional REST APIs. The client features three distinct interfaces: a desktop GUI (Tauri/React), a command-line interface (CLI), and a text-based user interface (TUI). All interfaces share core functionality through a common library, providing a consistent experience regardless of the interface used.

   - Documented architecture and API

## Next Steps

### Short-term Priorities

1. **Complete GUI Frontend**:
   - Implement React components based on the defined structure
   - Connect frontend components to Tauri backend
   - Add streaming UI components
   - Implement settings and configuration UI

2. **Testing and Quality Assurance**:
   - Add unit tests for core functionality
   - Create integration tests for interfaces
   - Test across different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Performance testing, especially startup time

3. **Deployment Preparation**:
   - Create Linux packages (DEB, AppImage)
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated builds
   - Prepare installation documentation
   - Create release process

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Enhanced Local Model Support**:
   - Replace placeholder implementation with real inference engine
   - Add model download and management UI
   - Improve model performance on resource-constrained devices
   - Add more local model options

2. **Improved UX Across Interfaces**:
   - Add guided onboarding for new users
   - Improve error messages and recovery
   - Add more keyboard shortcuts
   - Implement additional UI enhancements

3. **Cross-platform Refinements**:
   - Optimize for different operating systems
   - Improve installation experience
   - Add platform-specific features when appropriate
   - Ensure consistent behavior across platforms

### Long-term Vision

1. **Plugin System**:
   - Implement the plugin architecture
   - Create example plugins for common tasks
   - Add plugin management UI
   - Develop documentation for plugin developers

2. **Advanced Context Management**:
   - Implement advanced context handling for long conversations
   - Add context compression techniques
   - Support for document embeddings
   - Memory management for efficient token usage

3. **Collaborative Features**:
   - Shared conversations between users
   - Team workspaces
   - Real-time collaboration capabilities
   - Access control and permissions

4. **Enterprise Integration**:
   - Add enterprise authentication options
   - Support for organizational policies
   - Audit logging and compliance features
   - Integration with corporate systems

## Technical Debt

1. **Inference Engine**: The local model inference engine is currently a placeholder that needs to be replaced with a real implementation using llama.cpp or similar.

2. **Error Handling**: While the backend has comprehensive error handling, the frontend needs improved error recovery and user feedback.

3. **Testing Coverage**: Need more comprehensive testing across all components, especially for edge cases and error conditions.

4. **Documentation**: Internal API documentation needs improvement for easier developer onboarding.

## Conclusion

The Claude MCP Client has evolved into a comprehensive solution with multiple interfaces, offering flexibility in how users interact with Claude AI models. The CLI and TUI components are now complete, providing powerful terminal-based access, while the GUI is partially implemented with a strong backend foundation.

The project's architecture provides excellent separation of concerns through its layered design, with shared functionality in the common library ensuring consistency across interfaces. The implementation of the Model Context Protocol provides real-time interactions with Claude models, with intelligent routing and offline capabilities through local model support.

The next phase should focus on completing the GUI frontend, comprehensive testing, and preparing for deployment, while addressing technical debt and continuing to refine the user experience across all interfaces.
